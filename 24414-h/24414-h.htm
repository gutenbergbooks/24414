  OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>


<p><span class="sc">Mr. Redmond</span> is said to have
vigorously opposed the suggestion that
British troops should be sent to
Durazzo on the ground that the present
is not a time when our home
defences should be weakened.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The presence of some ladies on the
Holyhead links disturbed Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span> to such an extent, one day last
week, that he foozled a shot, and it is
reported that the Government is at last
contemplating serious steps against the
Suffragettes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<blockquote><p>
"<span class="sc">Lord Strathcona's Seat
for Sale.</span>"</p>

<p><i>Daily Mail.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>We would respectfully draw
Mr. <span class="sc">Masterman's</span> attention
to the above.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Europe's G.O.M., the Emperor
<span class="sc">Francis Joseph</span>, is now
so well that his doctor's
visits have been discontinued,
but the statement that he
went for a long ride last
week on a motor-bicycle is declared
to be an exaggeration.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to <i>The Express</i>
there was some little unpleasantness
in Paris last
week owing to the <span class="sc">Chairman</span>
of the London County Council
claiming precedence over
the <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span>. It is
thought that this could never
have happened had the <span class="sc">Lord
Mayor</span> taken his coachman
with him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Corsica is now claiming
that <span class="sc">Columbus</span> was born
there, and not in Genoa, and
there is much evidence to
prove that the claim is well-founded.
Still, it seems a little bit greedy of
Corsica, which already has some reputation
as the birth-place of another
distinguished man. It is possible, however,
that Genoa may give way if
somebody will reimburse her for the
very heavy expense of her statue of
<span class="sc">Columbus</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Owing to a strike the demand for
patent-leather boots for Ascot cannot
be met, and many visitors to this race
meeting will have to spend the day in
comfort.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The announcement that the Mappin
Terraces at the Zoo have now been
opened has, we hear, caused considerable
discontent among the animals in
the old-fashioned dens and cages. They
consider that these too ought to be
opened.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>By the way these new quarters are
proving so popular among the animals
that there is some talk of advertising
them extensively in Central Africa
and other haunts of big game with a
view to attracting new tenants to the
Regent's Park Garden City.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Regulations for the killing of flies
have been issued to the troops at
Aldershot. Curiously enough, artillery
is not to be employed. One would have
supposed that this sport might have
afforded invaluable training for bringing
down hostile aeroplanes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>From a statement just issued we
learn that Mr. A. <span class="sc">Lock</span>, of Edenbridge,
has slaughtered more than 18,000
queen wasps, and that for eighteen
successive years he has secured premier
honours for wasp-killing at a local
horticultural show. Orders, we learn
from an exceptionally well-informed
insect, have now been issued to the
W. (Wasps) S.P.U. to sting Mr. <span class="sc">Lock</span>
on sight.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"A census," we read, "is to be taken
of all the birds of the United States by
the American Board of Agriculture,"
but we are not told what particulars
will be asked for. Probably merely
name and address, not religion.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Pygmalion for Threepence" attracted
a large number of the working
classes to His Majesty's Theatre in
spite of the price being higher than
"A Twopenny Damn."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Among the workers' organisations
which booked seats was the London
Glass Blowers' Society. Hitherto, we
understand, the favourite expression of
the members of this Society has
been the innocuous "You
be blowed," and it is sincerely
to be hoped that Mr.
<span class="sc">Shaw's</span> play will not have
given these gentle souls a
taste for anything stronger.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>After holding up an elderly
man in broad daylight in an
arcade off Ludgate Hill last
week two highwaymen ran
away and were captured in
the Old Bailey. It is thought
that the homing instinct took
them there.</p>

<h2>A HAZARD ON THE HOME GREEN.</h2>

<p>Standing on our front door-step you can see our garden
running down at a moderate speed to our front gate. Or,
conversely, standing at the front gate, you can see it
mounting in a leisurely fashion to the front door. In
either case it consists of two narrow strips of lawn bisected
by a well-kept perambulator drive. Beyond the grass on
either side blooms a profusion of bless-my-soul-if-I-haven't-forgotten-agains
and other quaintly named old-world
English flowers. On the left-hand strip of lawn, looking
gatewards, is the metal pin to which the captive golf-ball
is tied. On the right is the pear-tree, to which later on we
have to affix a captive pear.</p>

<p>"What I like about the garden," I said to Araminta
when we first moved in, "is the fact that it is in front,
so that visitors, instead of saying in a perfunctory way,
'Have you got a garden, too? How delightful!' will be
forced to murmur, 'How sweet the clover smelt on your
lawn as we came up the drive. What a perfectly entrancing
golf-ball.' If I must go to the trouble and expense of
keeping up a private pleasaunce I want everybody to see
the pleasantry of it at once."</p>

<p>"Swank," replied Araminta. She is absurdly early-Georgian
in the matter of repartee.</p>

<p>Last Saturday I determined to mow the lawn. I put on
my oldest suit of clothes with the now fashionable slit-trouser
leg, fastened the green bonnet to the front of the
car, and wheeled it out of the tool garage. Araminta went
out, saying airily that she would be back to tea. After
a little trouble I induced the instrument to graze the left-hand
pasture as far as the hobbled Colonel. Then, feeling
that my shoulders wanted opening a bit, I went indoors
and fetched a brassie-spoon. I suppose I must have been
striking with unusual vehemence, but anyway, in playing
a good second to the fourteenth green, I sent the pin flying
out of the ground. The Colonel broke his parole and
dashed rapidly to the topmost boughs of the pear-tree on the
right, carrying the rest of the apparatus with him. There
was nothing to do but to follow him, spoon in hand.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that the pear-tree had been over-looked
during spring-cleaning, for the foliage, though very
luxuriant, was in an extremely soiled condition.</p>

<p>I had just located the deserter when I heard feminine
voices of unknown proprietorship. It is the habit of quick
masterful decisions in important crises that has given to
Englishmen an empire on which the sun never holes out,
and I decided instantly to remain where I was. If it had
been a mashie I might have faced them, but a brassie-spoon
out of a lie like that&mdash;no.</p>

<p>The callers came slowly up the path, rang the bell,
chattered to the servant, left cards, and retired. Without
much trouble I could have brained them with the brassie-spoon
as they passed beneath me. But some odd impulse
of chivalry restrained me. It is blunders like these that
have wrecked the plans of the greatest generals. Just as
they opened the gate who should appear but&mdash;of course&mdash;Araminta?
"Oh, I'm so glad I've caught you!" she cried.
"You <i>must</i> stay and have tea now. We'll have it in the
garden. My husband's somewhere about. He said he was
going to mow the lawn, but I suppose he was too lazy."
Lazy, indeed! Ha, ha! So like a woman.</p>

<p>Peering angrily with one eye out of my leafy ambush, I
tried hard to attract Araminta's attention, but all in vain.
Chairs were brought out and tea came with some particularly
cool-looking sandwiches; cups were filled; spoons clinked;
steadily the afternoon wore on. Flecks of fleecy white cloud
chased each other in the blue-domed heaven above me.
From far away rose the hum of the mighty city. In the
next-door garden but two I could see a happy family circle
partaking of light sustenance. I think it was nearly an
hour-and-a-half before those infernal women left. Araminta
conducted them to the gate, said a lingering good-bye, and
wafted them down the road with wavings and smiles.
When they were safely off the premises I slithered down
and confronted her, looking dignified and stern, still
holding the ball in one hand and the wooden club in the
other.</p>

<p>Instead of bursting into tears, as I had expected, she
went off into a fit of idiotic giggles. "You&mdash;you don't
mean to say you've been up in that tree all tea-time!
You are too funny. And you've got a great black splodge
over one eye. Do go and wash."</p>

<p>With an effort I controlled my rage. "In future," I
said coldly, "when I am&mdash;er&mdash;mowing the lawn, visitors
will be served with tea in the second drawing-room."</p>

<p>"All right, dear," said Araminta; "and in future, when
you are mowing the lawn, you shall have yours taken
up into the pear-tree."</p>

<p>Women have no sense of humour.</p>

<h2>TO BE OVERHEARD DAILY.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Restaurant.</i></p>

<p><i>First Luncher.</i> Waiter, bring me the
bill, please.</p>

<p><i>Waiter.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Second Luncher.</i> No, I say, old man,
this is mine. Waiter, bring the bill to
me.</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> No, waiter, it's mine.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> My dear old chap&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> Yes, it's mine. Get it, waiter.</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> But I asked you.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> No, I asked you.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> Yes, but I asked you first.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> That doesn't matter.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> Of course it does. And I've
been doing all the ordering too.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> That's all right. I'm glad
you have. You do it very well.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> Well, I want to pay.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> Oh, no, my dear fellow. It's
my lunch. I've been feeling like the
host all the time.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> So have I. I haven't felt like
a guest at all. It's my bill.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> I couldn't hear of it. You came
here to lunch with me.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> Upon my soul, I thought you
were lunching with me. I asked you,
you know.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> You can't deny I asked you;
I said, "We'll lunch together next
Thursday," didn't I?</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> That's all right, but I swear
I asked you first. It was because I
had asked you that you said what
you said.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> Well, I look on it as my
lunch, anyway.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> Then why did you let me
order the things and send back that
wine?</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> That's all right, old man.
You've been lunching with me to-day.
Next time I'll lunch with you.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> I'm not satisfied with it. I
consider this my lunch.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> No, no. It's mine. Here's
the waiter.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> Waiter, let me have that.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> No, waiter, give it to me.</p>

<p><i>S. L. (snatching the bill, glancing
at it, and hastily slamming down a
sovereign).</i> That's all right, waiter.
Keep the change.</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Yes, Sir; thank you, Sir.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> Waiter, don't take that money.
This is my affair.</p>

<p><i>W.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> It's all over now, old chap.
It's paid. Come along. (<i>Gets up.</i>)</p>

<p><i>F. L. (producing a sovereign).</i> That's
for the bill, waiter. I don't know anything
about that other money.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> But it's paid. It's done with.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> Oh, no. You mustn't do that.
It's my lunch. I asked you, you know.
Why, I told my wife this morning that
you were lunching with me to-day.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> I asked you first, you know.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> I don't think so, old chap; I
don't indeed.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> I assure you I never had a
shadow of doubt about it. I took it
for granted that you knew you were
lunching with me and I was the host.
Otherwise should I have made that
fuss about the omelette? Should I now?</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> I was very glad you did. I
felt that you felt at home.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> It puts me in such an awkward
position. Really, I should take it as a
personal favour if you'd let me pay.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> No, no. No, no. This is my
affair. I asked you.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> I asked you first.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> No, no. No, no. Come along.
Here's your sovereign.</p>

<p><i>S. L.</i> Well, I consent, but under
protest. Next time you really lunch
with me.</p>

<p><i>F. L.</i> Right-o. I'd love to.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dearest Daphne</span>,&mdash;This is completely
a <i>jewel</i> season. People may be
just as glittery as they like. Heads,
necks and arms don't monopolise the
pretty-pretties now, and, what with
jewelled tunics, girdles, shoes, stockings
and "<i>Honi soits</i>," as well as gems on
what little corsage and skirt one may
be wearing, one's jewel-box may be
quite <i>quite</i> emptied every evening.
Indeed, if we hadn't plenty of jewels
I sometimes wonder, my dear, what
our <i>grande toilette</i> would consist of!
And this has led to the
launching of "Olga's"
latest triumph, the lock-up
evening wrap&mdash;a
charming affair, thickly
plated with sequins and
fastening with the dearest
little <i>real</i> locks all down
the front from the throat
to the toes!</p>

<p><i>&Agrave; propos</i>, Beryl Clarges
had such a darling adventure
the other night. She
came out of the opera,
meaning to go on to the
Flummerys' and one or
two more places, with all
her pretty-pretties on,
and fastened securely into
her lock-up wrap. She
got into her car suspecting
nothing. But it
wasn't her own chauffeur
and footman at all,
Daphne! It was two
delicious robbers who'd
managed to get possession
of her car; and
they drove her out to
Hampstead Heath and held a pistol to
her head and said, "Now, my lady,
you've got on about thirty-thousand
pound worth of sparklers. Hand 'em
over quietly and we won't hurt you."
And Beryl didn't turn a hair (she says)
but answered, "You silly boys! I'm
locked into 'Olga's' new thief-proof
wrap and you can't get anything but
my shoes. My maid always locks me
in and lets me out, and she's got the
keys and you've left her behind!"
And they tried to wrench the wrap
open, but it resisted, and Beryl put in
some piercing g's in alt., and help came
and the robbers fled. And now she's
the woman of the moment, and her
picture, standing on Hampstead Heath
in her lock-up wrap, defying ten
robbers, is in all the weeklies.</p>

<p>Some people say it was all managed
by her publicity agent, and others
declare it was a put-up thing between
Beryl and "Olga." Anyhow, the new
"<i>manteau de s&ucirc;ret&eacute;</i>" is absolutely booming,
and <i>entre nous</i>, <i>ch&eacute;rie</i>, people who
never wear anything more valuable
than sequins and paste are quite falling
over each other to get thief-proof wraps!</p>

<p>There's quite a little rage among
girls just now for <i>boxing</i>. Juno
Farrington, the Southlands' girl, is responsible
for it. She's been the
acknowledged leader of the <i>jeunes filles</i>
since she first came out and has set
the fashion among them in everything,
from inventing a new cocktail to
chaperoning her chaperon. (It was
Juno who first started the custom at
parties of doing all the after-supper
dances in the street and finishing up
the night at an early coffee-stall.) The
Duchess of Southlands was making her
little moan to me the other day, and I
told her she ought to be so proud of
dear Juno having <i>temperament</i> and <i>personality</i>.
"Temperament and personality
are all very well, Blanche," said
the dear little invertebrate woman,
"but worried mothers wish they didn't
develop till after marriage! If Juno's
grandmamma knew how <i>modern</i> she
is she'd leave everything she has to
charity." Indeed it's a constant effort
for her parents to hide their girl's
modernity from the dowager&mdash;a dear
old disapproving piece of antiquity
whose youth dates from remote ages
of blushing, fainting, accomplishments
and downcast eyes. She's an immense
fortune to leave, and Juno (so far) is
her heiress; but the girl seriously imperilled
her prospects during the very
last visit the Southlands had from the
dowager. The latter was doing her
everlasting knitting one day when she
called out, "Here, Juno, child, come
and help me. I've dropped a stitch."
And Juno went to her and looked about
on the floor and said, "Where did you
drop it, Gran? I don't see it anywhere!"</p>

<p>I'd a little dinner-dance on Thursday
and Juno was one of several girls who
brought their mothers. "Oh, my hat
and feathers!" she called out as she
looked over the menu; "none of your
<i>&agrave; la</i> dishes for <i>this</i> child! Sorry, old
girl, but I'm in training. Will you
order broiled steak and pale ale for
me? I'm going to box
Tricky Sal, the coloured
girl-boxer from the Other
Side. Wonder how she'll
like my upper-cut and
left-hand jab! Isn't it
glorious, people? I've
got my ambition! I'm
a White Hope! See if we
don't fill the Colidrome
at our Grand Boxing
Matin&eacute;e!"</p>

<p>"Girlie," pleaded <i>la
m&egrave;re</i>, "you're joking!
You wouldn't dream of
boxing except before just
relations and intimate
friends!" "Relations and
intimate friends be <i>somethinged</i>!"
cried Juno.
"I'm going to box in
front of the good old
public! And the gate
shall go to your Holiday
Home for Melancholy
Manicurists, mother
dear." "My only one, my
Melancholy Manicurists
are quite <i>quite</i> in funds,"
urged the duchess; "we want nothing
for them." "Don't worry your little
head, dear," said Juno; "they've <i>got</i> to
be helped and that's all about it!"</p>

<p>So the matin&eacute;e at the Colidrome is
to come off. The <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>
will, of course, be Juno Farrington and
Tricky Sal. Then the Dunstables' two
girls, Franky and Freckles, have promised
a sparring match if their mother
doesn't get to hear of it down at Dunstable
Castle (they're going out with
their aunt this season). Beryl and
Babs will wrestle. And they want me
to give a show with the Indian clubs
(no one does them quite as I do, but
I'm not a bit vain about it). Every
seat is sold already!</p>

<p>I believe people never had such a
horror of bores and banality as they
have now&mdash;owing chiefly to the influence
of our Anti-Banalite Club.
Silent dinners, at which one communicates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>[pg 447]</span>
only by wireless, are a good deal
done and are quite nice and restful, the
general atmosphere (if someone tainted
with banalism seems inclined to speak)
being, "I know what you're going to
say. Please&mdash;please&mdash;<i>please</i> don't say
it!" On a little dinner of this kind at
Bosh and Wee-Wee's last week there
descended a terrible man, a far-away
cousin of Wee-Wee's, who hardly ever
leaves his <i>terres</i> in some remote part of
the country&mdash;the sort of creature, you
know, dearest, who always has a colour
and a smile and an appetite and who
writes to the papers to say he's seen
a bush growing upside down or has
heard the cuckoo singing in the night
or has plucked and eaten something in
his garden in December! He began by
<i>mentioning the weather</i>! People quite
jumped in their chairs, and Popsy, Lady
Ramsgate, gave a little scream. He
followed this up by saying <i>town seemed
full</i>; and then, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of having run
up against a college friend in town,
informed us that <i>the world was a
small place after all</i>! When this last
enormity was let loose upon us Norty
said solemnly, "Where's the nearest
point policeman?" And, instead of
taking the hint, the creature began to
hold forth about "that fine body of
men, the London police!" Wee-Wee
was in sackcloth and ashes about it
afterwards. She says that sort of
thing is in his family.</p>

<p>I had a serious talk with Norty
about the Irish problem yesterday, and
he tells me there's a whisper in the
Lobbies that <i>certain persons</i> have already
sold the kinema rights of the
first Irish Parliament to a film company
for a <i>colossal</i> sum and, as the money
is spent and the company is <i>incessantly</i>
jogging them to deliver the goods,
they're bound to put the thing through!
It's said that someone asked a Member
of the Government point-blank whether
there was any truth in the rumour,
and was told, "The answer is in the
negative-affirmative, Sir!"</p>

<p>Ever thine,</p>

<h2>THE COMPLETE DRAMATIST.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">II.&mdash;Exits and Entrances.</span></h3>

<p>To the young playwright, the difficulty
of getting his characters on to
the stage would seem much less than
the difficulty of finding them something
to say when they are there. He writes
gaily and without hesitation "<i>Enter</i>
Lord Arthur Fluffinose," and only then
begins to bite the end of his penholder
and gaze round his library for inspiration.
Yet it is on that one word
"Enter" that his reputation for dramatic
technique will hang. Why did
<i>Lord Arthur Fluffinose</i> enter? The
obvious answer, that the firm which is
mentioned in the programme as supplying
his trousers would be annoyed
if he didn't, is not enough; nor is it
enough to say that the whole plot of
the piece hinges on him, and that
without him the drama would languish.
What the critic wants to know is why
<i>Lord Arthur</i> chose that very moment to
come in&mdash;the very moment when <i>Lady
Larkspur</i> was left alone in the oak-beamed
hall of Larkspur Towers. Was
it only a coincidence? And if the
young dramatist answers callously,
"Yes," it simply shows that he has no
feeling for the stage whatever. In
that case I needn't go on with these
articles.</p>

<p>However, it will be more convenient
to assume, dear reader, that in your
play <i>Lord Arthur</i> had a good reason
for coming in. If that be so, he must
explain it. It won't do to write like
this:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Lord Arthur. Lady Larkspur
<i>starts suddenly and turns towards
him.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Larkspur.</i> Arthur! <i>You</i> here?
(<i>He gives a nod of confirmation. She
pauses a moment, and then with a
sudden passionate movement flings herself
into his arms.</i>) Take me away,
Arthur. I can't bear this life any
longer. Larkspur bit me again this
morning for the <i>third</i> time. I want to
get away from it all. [<i>Swoons.</i></p>

<p>The subsequent scene may be so
pathetic that on the hundredth night it
is still bringing tears to the eyes of the
fireman, but you must not expect to be
treated as a serious dramatist. You
will see this for yourself if you consider
the passage as it should properly have
been written:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Lord Arthur Fluffinose. Lady
Larkspur <i>looks at him with amazement.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Larkspur.</i> Arthur, what are <i>you</i>
doing here?</p>

<p><i>Lord Arthur.</i> I caught the 2.3 from
town. It gets in at 3.37, and I walked
over from the station. It's only a
mile. (<i>At this-point he looks at the
grandfather clock in the corner, and the
audience, following his eyes, sees that it
is seven minutes to four, which appears
delightfully natural.</i>) I came to tell
Larkspur to sell Bungoes. They are
going down.</p>

<p><i>Lady Larkspur (folding her hands
over her chest and gazing broodingly at
the footlights).</i> Larkspur!</p>

<p><i>Lord Arthur (anxiously).</i> What is it?
(<i>Suddenly</i>) Has he been ill-treating
you again?</p>

<p><i>Lady Larkspur (flinging herself into
his arms).</i> Oh, Arthur, Arthur, he bit
me this morning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>But it may well be that <i>Lord Larkspur</i>
has an intrigue of his own with
his secretary, <i>Miss Devereux</i>, and, if
their big scene is to take place on the
stage too, the hall has got to be cleared
for them in some way. Your natural
instinct will be to say, "<i>Exeunt</i> Fluffinose
<i>and</i> Lady Larkspur, <i>R. Enter</i>
Lord Larkspur <i>and</i> Miss Devereux, <i>L.</i>"
This is very immature, even if you are
quite clear as to which side of the stage
is L. and which is R. You <i>must</i> make
the evolutions seem natural. Thus:&mdash;<i>Enter
from the left</i> Miss Devereux.</p>

<p><i>She stops in surprise at seeing</i> Lord
Arthur <i>and holds out her hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss D.</i> Why, Lord Arthur! Whatever&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord A.</i> How d'you do? I've just
run down to tell Lord Larkspur to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss D.</i> He's in the library. At
least he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord A. (taking out his watch).</i> Ah,
then perhaps I'd better&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>Exit by door on left.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss D. (to Lady L.).</i> Have you seen
<i>The Times</i> about here? There is a set
of verses in the Financial Supplement
which Lord Larkspur wanted to&mdash;&mdash;(<i>She
wanders vaguely round the room.
Enter </i>Lord Larkspur<i> by door at back</i>).
Why, here you are! I've just sent
Lord Arthur into the library to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord L.</i> I went out to speak to the
gardener about&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Ah, then I'll go and tell
Lord&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>Exit to library, leaving</i> Miss
Devereux <i>and</i> Lord Larkspur <i>alone.</i></p>

<p>And there you are. You will, of
course, appreciate that the unfinished
sentences not only save time, but also
make the man&oelig;uvring very much more
natural.</p>

<p>So far I have been writing as if you
were already in the thick of your play;
but it may well be that the enormous
difficulty of getting the first character
on has been too much for you. How,
you may be wondering, are you to
begin your masterpiece?</p>

<p>The answer to this will depend upon
the length of the play, for upon the
length depends the hour at which the
curtain rises. If yours is an 8.15 play
you may be sure that the stalls will
not fill up till 8.30, and you should
therefore let loose the lesser-paid members
of the cast on the opening scene,
keeping your fifty-pounders in reserve.
In a 9 o'clock play the audience may be
plunged into the drama at once. But
this is much the more difficult thing
to do, and for the beginner I should
certainly recommend the 8.15 play,
for which the recipe is simple.</p>

<p>As soon as the lights go down, and
while the bald stout gentleman is kicking
our top-hat out of his way, treading
heavily on our toes and wheezing,
"Sorry, sorry," as he struggles to
his seat, a buzz begins behind the
curtain. What the players are saying
is not distinguishable, but a merry
girlish laugh rings out now and
then, followed by the short sardonic
chuckle of an obvious man of the world.
Then the curtain rises, and it is apparent
that we are assisting at an At
Home of considerable splendour. Most
of the characters seem to be on the
stage, and for once we do not ask how
they got there. We presume they have
all been invited. Thus you have had
no difficulty with your entrances.</p>

<p><i>As the chatter dies down a chord is
struck on the piano.</i></p>

<p><i>The Bishop of Sploshington (&pound;2 10s.
a week).</i> Charming. Quite one of my
favourites. Do play it again. [<i>Relapses
into silence for the rest of the evening.</i></p>

<p><i>The Duchess of Southbridge (35s. per
week, to</i> Lord Reggie). Oh, Reggie,
what <i>did</i> you say?</p>

<p><i>Lord Reggie (putting up his eyeglass&mdash;they
get five shillings a week extra if
they can manage an eyeglass properly).</i>
Said I'd bally well&mdash;top-hole&mdash;what?&mdash;don'cherknow.</p>

<p><i>Lady Evangeline (to</i> Lady Violet, <i>as
they walk across the stage).</i> Oh, I <i>must</i>
tell you what that funny Mr. Danby
said. [<i>Doesn't.</i> Lady Violet, <i>none the
less, trills with happy laughter.</i></p>

<p><i>Prince von Ichdien, the well-known
Ambassador (loudly, to an unnamed
gentleman).</i> What your country ought
to do&mdash;&mdash;[<i>He finishes his remarks
in the lip-language, which the unnamed
gentleman seems to understand. At
any rate he nods several times.</i></p>

<p><i>There is more girlish laughter, more
buzz and more deaf-and-dumb language.
Then</i></p>

<p><i>Lord Tuppeny.</i> Well, what about
auction?</p>

<p><i>Amid murmurs of</i> "You'll play,
Field-Marshal?" <i>and</i> "Auction, Archbishop?"
<i>the crowd drifts off, leaving
the hero and heroine alone in the middle
of the stage.</i></p>

<p>And then you can begin.</p>

<h2>THE NAKED TRUTH.</h2>

<p>[<i>A correspondent, having failed to let
his property through the ordinary
channels of advertisement, falls back
upon "Mr. Punch's" help, having
noticed in his pages several examples
of the charm of Commercial Candour.</i>]</p>

<p>House to be Sold, with Garage&mdash;or
can be let alone; detached (owing
to subsidence of soil); standing on its
own ground (except for a small portion
which is lying in neighbour's yard).
There are three stories: (1) that it is
haunted, (2) that it is unfit for human
habitation, (3) that it is mortgaged up
to the hilt. The title is undisputed.</p>

<p>The house faces N. and S.&mdash;or <i>did</i>
when last inspected. It commands a
magnificent view of the back gardens
of the next street, where a weekly
regatta is held every Monday. For
lovers of music there is a piano next
door and five gramophones within
audible distance; an organ plays every
Saturday at the house opposite.</p>

<p>The sky-light affords an unobstructed
view of the firmament&mdash;not surpassed
in the wilds of Scotland.</p>

<p>The garden is small, but cannot possibly
be overlooked even by the most
short-sighted and unobservant. The
soil is very fertile, grass growing readily
under the feet. The presence of the
early bird indicates an abundance of
ground game. There is some fine
ancient timber in a corner, possibly
the remains of a bicycle shed.</p>

<p>On the ground floor are three sitting-rooms,
each with standing room also;
every one of them is a study. There
is no actual smoking-room, but one can
be improvised in a moment by lighting
any of the fires. There is a large attic
suitable for a billiard-room for short
men. The wine-cellar contains fifty
cubic feet of water, thus ensuring a
uniform temperature; there is a large
collection of empty bottles, which could
be left. The water supply is constant,
so also are the applications for rates.
The drains on the property are immense.
There is gas all over the house.
Summonses are served at the door, and
the tradesmen call many times daily
and wait if you are out.</p>

<p>The owner is obliged to go abroad
for private reasons and must dispose of
the property at once. The house, being
concrete, can be seen at any time, or
an abstract can be had on application
to the Caretaker who is within&mdash;or
should be. If not within will be found
at the "King's Arms" next door. For
particulars apply to Phibbs and Gammon,
Jerry Buildings, Wapping.</p>

<h2>AN ADVANCE FINALE.</h2>

<p>There is an idea already fermenting
in the brains of many publishers that
their present method of printing personal
assurances as to the merits of
their new productions is unsatisfactory.
It is felt that these eulogies are open
to the suspicion of prejudice and should
be replaced, or supplemented, by the advance
publication of the final chapter
of the author's work. <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
anxious to promote this excellent
change by the publication of a specimen
finale, has pleasure in anticipating
the fifty-first, and concluding, chapter
of Mrs. <span class="sc">H-mphry W-rd's</span> projected
romance, <i>The Winning of Aurora</i>; and
he is convinced that his readers will
not rest till they have secured the
remaining fifty chapters.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Aurora let fall the book she was
reading, a celebrated pamphlet on the
Oxford Tractarian movement, in a
cover which was a miracle of Italo-Moroccan
tooling, and gazed thoughtfully
at the scene before her. Viewed
thus in outline, her head in repose had
something of the delicacy of a Tanagra
figure, while to the eye of a connoisseur
the magnificent yet girlish torso might
have recalled a Bacchante by <span class="sc">Skopas</span>.
To her right rose the rugged sides of
Garthfell, purple and scarlet in the
subdued light; to the left was Felsbeck,
and from her feet the ground fell away
abruptly till it met the immemorial
woods of Supwell. Among them Aurora
could distinguish the massive Boadicean
keep of Supwell Castle, strangely
yet harmoniously blended with the neo-Byzantine
portico of white marble
designed by <span class="sc">Inigo Jones</span> for the thirty-first
Earl. She remembered vaguely
that she was attending a reception
there to-night; but her gaze soon left
the noble pile&mdash;so typical of all that is
best in English architecture&mdash;to rest
upon the humbler neighbouring group
of Lowmere cottages. In one she
knew old Ralph, the shepherd, was
dying of a painful form of spinal
catarrh, directly attributable to the
cesspool at his front door; in another
the mother of fifteen children was
nursing the only remaining one through
an attack of mumps, and in a third the
breadwinner was lying in the malignant
grip of abdominal influenza. Aurora
mentally reviewed the chief points of
Socialism, Individualism, Syndicalism
and Socinianism, as represented by
the select group of thinkers to which
Cecil belonged.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Following a noiseless footman in the
gorgeous Supwell liveries, Mrs. Lovelord
and Aurora took up their position
under a rare palm at the head of the
great ebony staircase, which a royal
personage was said to have coveted,
and watched the Earl and Countess
receive their guests. Mrs. Lovelord's
keen eye noted that the Earl was
standing on the Countess's train, a
priceless piece of Venetian point which
had once belonged to the <span class="sc">Empress
Theodora</span>. Aurora's attention was
attracted by a tall grey-haired man
wearing the Ribbon of the Garter half-hidden
under a variety of lesser decorations;
he was talking eagerly, vivaciously
to the notorious Duchess of
Almondsbury. Cecil, who had joined
Aurora at once, whispered that the
man was Professor Villeray.</p>

<p>"They say he knows every crowned
head in Europe," he said. The great
scientist was relating anecdote after
anecdote of the people he had known&mdash;<span class="sc">Charlemagne</span>,
<span class="sc">Machiavelli</span>, <span class="sc">Newman</span>,
<span class="sc">Dickens</span>, the <span class="sc">Shakspeares</span>, father
and son. There followed a racy story,
inimitably told, of Miss <span class="sc">Mitford</span> in
her less regenerate days. Aurora turned
away.</p>

<p>"Would you care to take a turn
through the rooms?" Cecil asked.
"The Rembrandts are in tremendous
form to-night&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>The house was one of historic interest
and importance, with that blend of
magnificence and domesticity so typical
of all that is best in English life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>[pg 454]</span>
Aurora's eyes wandered from the massive
emerald chandeliers, the envy of
every connoisseur in Europe, to
<span class="sc">Raphael's</span> masterly "Madonna," which,
with a daring harmony by <span class="sc">Sargent</span>,
filled the niches on either side of the
great mantelpiece, itself a triumph of
the art of <span class="sc">Niccola</span> of Pisa.</p>

<p>"There's Sir John. I didn't think
he'd be here with all this
rumpus over the Bill," said Cecil.
The Prime Minister was deep in
conversation with the Marquis of
Falutin, P.T.O., Q.T., R.S.V.P.,
the famous diplomat, whose recent
intervention in the Nice
imbroglio had saved the European
situation. Aurora could
see the flashes of his wit illuminating
Sir John's saturnine
countenance. Her further progress
was barred by Lady
Highflyer, who nodded to her,
and said to Cecil, whose <i>petite
intimit&eacute;</i> with all this great world
struck Aurora anew:</p>

<p>"You heard Philip's got
Jericho?" He nodded. "Such
a relief. The Duke's delighted,
of course, especially after poor
Erskine's fiasco, or perhaps I
should say <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. He's infatuated,
I hear. Only &pound;20,000
a year between them! Ah, there's
Madeline Duchess. Well, <i>a
rivederci</i>."</p>

<p>She passed on, her dress,
which had taxed the resources
of the first modistes of the day,
Rue de la Paix, trailing heedlessly
over the priceless Aubusson.
Aurora turned to find the
Home Secretary at her elbow.
Instantly she was all eagerness
and vivacity.</p>

<p>"Will there be a division?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Dear lady," he replied, "<i>qui
vivra verra</i>. The Anabaptists
are up in arms, but&mdash;&mdash;" He
screwed his glass into his eye.
"Had anything to eat?" he
asked, as three of the footmen
passed with a jewelled tray of
P&ecirc;ches Melba. "A Benvenuto
Cellini, if I am not mistaken," he
continued, tapping the tray with his
ring, a unique Pompeian intaglio of
Venus Anadyomene with the iynx.
"The plates are fourteenth-century
Venetian. The only other set is in
the Vatican, you remember." He
removed a drop of the Earl's champagne
from his moustache. "Ah, I see
Cantoforte's going to sing. Marvellous
man! I remember him in Paris in the
'forties&mdash;the roaring 'forties, as poor
<span class="sc">Dizzy</span> called them."</p>

<p>"He only plays when Royalty's
present," a woman behind Aurora
whispered, as the great artist broke
into <span class="sc">Palestrina's</span> <i>Andante Furioso</i>.
"They say he charges a thousand a
minute."</p>

<p>A memory of the Lowmere cottages
assailed Aurora. At last she saw her
way clearly. Never had she so realised
the possibilities of life.</p>

<p>"I will marry Cecil," she said to herself.
"With his brains, a million a
year, and the breeding to which only
the highest circles can attain, we will
regenerate England."</p>

<h2>THE CAN-CAN.</h2>

<p>I have four milk-boys as pets. They
don't know it, but I cultivate an intimate
knowledge of their habits and
study them as, once, years ago, I was
wont to study white mice and goldfish.
I have watched their development,
listened to their song, and have made
several interesting discoveries
about them.</p>

<p>When, after a hard evening's
reading, perhaps, I jot down a
few notes and tumble into bed
at 1 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, I do so with the delightful
certainty that at 6.30
the first of my pets will rouse
me with his mellow warbling.
He (Number One) looks always
on the bright side of things and
probably belongs to a club for
incurable optimists, for he intersperses
his roulades with
cheery spells of whistling.
Should Number Two, who is a
pal of his, loom through the
early morning mist with the lark
and the first motor-bus at the
other end of the Terrace, no
false modesty deters him from
making himself known; he
gives a view-halloo that startles
every drooping cat in the district.
He informs Number Two, while
that person is yet nebulous, a
mere blur on the cosmos, that he
went to the local Empire last
night, and that it was a bit of all
right. With an intermittent
rumble he elicits the information
that Geor-r-rge (that's Number
Two's name) went to his local
Palace and had a treat of a
beano. And when they meet&mdash;exactly
opposite my dwelling is
the favoured spot&mdash;the Can-can
is performed with variations.
Jolly fellows are One and Two.</p>

<p>As for Number Three, I could
tell you a little story about him.
He has had a love-affair. There
was a time when he too joined
in the dance and song, as one
might say; but all that is over
for him. One morning he turned
up late, his usual merry call changed
to a croak like that of a bull-frog
virtuoso. I peered between the curtains
to make sure that it was not
Number Five (as yet hypothetical);
but no&mdash;it was Three, with a look
on his face that could only bear
one interpretation. Belinda had been
perverse, unkind, icy&mdash;had, in fact,
thrown him over. You could read it in
the angle of his cap, in the broken lace
dragging from his boots, in his shuffling
progress, and in the dulled gleam of his
brass-mounted cans. From that date
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>[pg 455]</span>
he became a frowning pessimist, perpetrating
wheezes and squeaks and
mumblings, quaverings and hoarse
murmurs, instead of the customary
sportive yelp. 'Tis an unkind world,
according to Number Three.</p>

<p>Number Four generally arrives as
the lingering chatter of his predecessors
dies away. He is rotund, judging by
his voice (I have not yet seen him);
also I should say that he goes in for
physical culture. For, by the sounds
that ascend to my window, his procedure
is as follows: he unhooks the
empty can from the railings of the
opposite house and dashes it violently
upward against the wall, catching it
on the rebound. This action he repeats
a few times just to get into form;
it is, as it were, a muscular prelude.
Then, taking seven or eight empty tins
from his trolley, he juggles with them,
not very expertly, for some of them
break away into neighbouring areas
and have to be retrieved; or he will
set the whole lot in the road and kick
them round for five minutes, brilliantly
and wonderfully. This warms him.
Picking them up, he spends a relatively
quiet interlude in sorting out the one
he wants, then fills it, bangs the lid
down, and rehangs it in position.
Having repeated the process with the
remainder, he glows with a sense of
duty done, and bursts into his farewell
song; I often wish that it was his
swan-song. He produces in this vocal
valediction noises which to the ears of
a Futurist composer might seem as
Olympian music, but which to my
insufficiently educated taste are merely
excruciating.</p>

<p>These, then are my four pets. I
value them, for they teach me self-denial
and self-restraint; they rouse
me at an hour when I might otherwise
be lost in slothful sleep; and they
assure me that there is a sphere in
which taxes and politics really do not
matter in the slightest. Some day, I
suppose, they will grow up. What
will become of their talents in the
world of men it is beyond me to
imagine. But Number Four seems to
have the makings of a politician.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">A Pretty Thought.</span></p>

<p><i>After reading that a number of
letters have been written to the King
on his birthday by school children,
my wife and I have decided that our
little girl, Clara, who is just six, shall
write one for next year&mdash;or possibly
for Christmas&mdash;and we should be glad
of your counsel in the matter: as to
how his Majesty is addressed, how to
make sure that the letter reaches him
and receives proper attention, and so
forth. Is there any intermediary with
whom one should get upon good terms?&mdash;J.
U. T. (Haggerston).</i></p>

<p>Your question is a very natural one,
and we are glad to be able to reply to
it. The habit of writing to <span class="sc">His Majesty</span>
is growing. He should be addressed on
the envelope as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">His Majesty</span>,</p>
<p class="i4">Buckingham Palace,</p>
<p class="i8">near Victoria Station,</p>
<p class="i10">      S.W.,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and the envelope should be marked
"Private" or "Personal," to ensure his
getting it. By a piece of great good
fortune for you one of the papers has
very considerately published specimens
of letters just sent to <span class="sc">His Majesty</span>, and
you can make those your model. The
most suitable is perhaps this&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<span class="sc">Dear King George</span>,&mdash;I wish you many
happy returns of the day. If I had one pound
I would buy a suit of clothes with ten shillings
and a watch for the other ten shillings. I hope
you will have a long and fruitful reign."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Is not that charming in its <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and
whole-hearted delight in the opportunity
of congratulations and good
wishes? We wish your little Clara all
success.</p>

<p>We reply to your question by asking
another. How is it that these gentlemen,
with all their advantages of foreknowledge,
are still so anxiously in
business?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Our Feathered Friends.</span></p>

<p><i>Can you tell me how I can obtain

walk in the New Forest to instruct
him in English ornithology. Do you
think he would take me? I am a
strong Free Trader and have traces of
American blood.&mdash;B. B. L. (Dorking).</i></p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Edward Grey</span>, we fancy, has
other things to do. You had better
write to "W. B. T." of <i>The Daily

"P. W. D. I."</p>

<p><i>I have a son for whom I desire a

to get for him is a Member of Parliament

one who was jealous for the honour
and dignity of the House, and I need
hardly say that I should not care for
a Liberal. Can you give me any
hints?&mdash;J. K. (Henley).</i></p>

<p>We strongly recommend Mr. <span class="sc">Ronald

<h2>A WELCOME FLAW.</h2>

<p>"You look worried," said Diana,
"very worried, dear."</p>

<p>I smiled sadly. "It can't be helped,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Did you like my cake?"</p>

<p>"Very much; it wasn't that. I am
a little worried, Diana."</p>

<p>"What a pity. Will you have some
more, dear?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>Diana leant forward and cut a very
large slice.</p>

<p>"No, really, thank you," I insisted.</p>

<p>"Right; this is for me."</p>

<p>"Diana," I said, "I've something
on my chest." She looked surprised.
"Yes, there's something on my chest.
I speak in a spiritual sense."</p>

<p>"Well, hadn't you better tell me
what it is, dear?"</p>

<p>"I will," I said stoutly. "Diana,
this&mdash;this engagement can't go on."
There was no fire in the room, so I
gazed blankly into the radiator.</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean, Dick?"</p>

<p>"It can't go on," I repeated.</p>

<p>"Why? Dick, you're joking."</p>

<p>"Joking!" I laughed a hollow
mocking laugh. "Don't make it hard
for me, Diana."</p>

<p>She crossed over and sat on the arm
of my chair.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling ill, dear?" she
inquired ever so sweetly.</p>

<p>For a moment I nearly gave way;
then, with a tremendous effort, I braced
back my shoulders.... Diana fell
heavily to the floor.</p>

<p>"Darling," I said as I picked her up,
"I'm so sorry; I didn't see you were
sitting so near the edge. I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," she replied. "And now
what is it? You haven't changed towards
me?"</p>

<p>"Diana&mdash;I&mdash;oh, it's difficult."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Go on."</p>

<p>I gazed into the carpet. "I must
begin at the beginning. I&mdash;it's difficult."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; we've agreed about
that."</p>

<p>"In the first place," I began, "I am
a man of the utmost integrity."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter, and, anyway,
you're quite a dear."</p>

<p>I bowed gravely. "I try to look
at things from a high standpoint," I
continued. "Now, Diana, I consider
you are perfect. I love you intensely
because you are so perfect."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, dear."</p>

<p>"I mean it. On the other hand, I
know myself very well indeed."</p>

<p>"You think so."</p>

<p>"I do. And I have come to the
conclusion, after many racking hours,
that I am not worthy of you. The
proper course, the only course, is for
me to release you." And I sighed
heavily.</p>

<p>"Well," said Diana, "of course it's
a very pretty idea, and I'm glad you're
so fond of me, but the whole thing's
absurd. I've accepted you and there's
an end of it."</p>

<p>"Diana, you're making it very hard."</p>

<p>"I'm making it impossible."</p>

<p>"No," I declared, "because&mdash;I release
you now."</p>

<p>Diana fingered her handkerchief.
"D&mdash;Dick, I refuse to be released.
It's too silly for w&mdash;words. Come
over here."</p>

<p>With a great effort I didn't get up;
instead I gazed at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Diana," I said, "I'm disappointed
in you. I'm trying to do the right
thing, the noble thing, and you mustn't
stand in my way. You've no right
to stand in my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>[pg 457]</span>

<p>"Anyhow, I'm going to."</p>

<p>"You know," I said, "this puts me
in a very awkward position&mdash;very
awkward. Diana, you must see my
point of view."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"You mean you won't. I had expected
more of you."</p>

<p>Diana smiled. "I thought you considered
me perfect."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, dear, I'm not."</p>

<p>I sighed. "I'm afraid not," I said.
"I fear not."</p>

<p>Suddenly I sat up. "Good Lord!"
I exclaimed. "Hooray!"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see? This puts matters
on an entirely different footing. Darling,
you don't want me to do the right thing,
therefore you're not perfect."</p>

<p>"No; that's settled."</p>

<p>"Well then, you don't deserve a perfect
husband."</p>

<p>"I don't want one."</p>

<p>"That's not the point. You don't
deserve one."</p>

<p>"No," said Diana.</p>

<p>"Then that's all right," I said;
"because you won't get one." And I
cut myself a large slice of cake.</p>

<h2>THE ABANDONER.</h2>

<p>"I am afraid," I said, "that I shall have to withdraw my
permission."</p>

<p>"Withdraw your what?" said the lady of the house,
emphasising every word scornfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I shall have to forbid you to go."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"It's not a bit of good," I said, "laughing like that.
Laughter only adds fuel to the fire that is raging in my
breast. I am going to forbid you to go."</p>

<p>"Don't waste your forbiddings," she said, "I'm not
banns, and I won't be treated as such. Besides, even banns
are never forbidden in these days."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are," I said. "A bann was forbidden last
week. A father of eighty years, infuriated by the imminent
desertion of a daughter of fifty-five, got up in church at the
third time of asking and said, 'I object. Who's going to
look after me?' The clergyman nearly swooned."</p>

<p>"And the unfortunate objecter was carefully removed by
his friends. I don't see that that's much of a help to you."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," I said, "I won't have it."</p>

<p>"It's too late to talk like that. In half-an-hour I start
for Sandy Bay to stay with Violet. My luggage is already
at the station."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "and you leave me here alone to look
after everything."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" she said. "Don't you often leave
<i>me</i> alone here to look after everything?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but that's different. When I go away <i>rien n'est
chang&eacute;; il n'y a qu'un Anglais de moins</i>."</p>

<p>"My own Parisian one!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"The mistress-mind remains and things go on being controlled.
Lord love you, <i>my</i> absence makes no difference."</p>

<p>"What you mean is," she said, "that you simply can't
get on without me. Isn't that it?"</p>

<p>"If you put it in that way," I said, "you can't expect
me to admit it."</p>

<p>"Well, it comes to that, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"What I mean to say is that it's your fault."</p>

<p>"Aha," she said triumphantly, "I knew you'd mean to
say that sooner or later. Everything's my fault, of course."</p>

<p>"It is," I said, "an arguable proposition."</p>

<p>"And how do you prove it in this particular case?"</p>

<p>"Easily," I said. "You have neglected to train me for
the daily work of a household and a family."</p>

<p>"You never asked to be trained," she said.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I was too proud and too sensitive. I did
not come to you and say, 'Let me beard the cook in her
fastness. Let me order the sirloin of beef for the mid-day
meal. Let me rebuke the housemaid, or raise her wages,
or give her notice,' or whatever it is that one does in the
case of a housemaid. I did not ask that I too might be
allowed to talk bulbs or Alpine plants to the gardener.
I did not plead that I might order dresses or medicine for
the girls, or watch over John's putting to bed. All these
things, because you were haughty about them, I left to
you; and you&mdash;what did you do?"</p>

<p>"I generally went and did them."</p>

<p>"And that," I said, "is just what I complain of."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have liked it," she said, "if I hadn't."</p>

<p>"You ought," I said, "to have taken me into your
counsels, instead of leaving me to eat out my heart in total
ignorance of all the things that make the world a happier
and a better place. Votes for women, indeed! First let
there be homes for men."</p>

<p>"Shall I ring for a glass of water?" she said.</p>

<p>"There must be no sarcasm," I said. "This is too serious
for sarcasm. Besides, think what will happen."</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"John," I said, "will fall into the fishpond."</p>

<p>"You can have his clothes dried."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I shall spank him. It is my only remedy."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Peggy will tumble off her bicycle and cut her knee."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, you can't spank her for that."</p>

<p>"And there will be a message from the kitchen to say
that there are no mutton cutlets in England."</p>

<p>"You can eat beef or chicken."</p>

<p>"And Rosie will have to see the dentist, and Helen will
want to go out to tea, and there will be holes in all their
boots; and ladies whom I have never seen will call on you
and will be shown in on me. Oh, it is a terrible prospect!"</p>

<p>"It does sound rather blood-curdling," she said.</p>

<p>"And, after all, why do you want to go to Violet's?"</p>

<p>"She asked me, you know. That's one reason. And I
shall be able to look round for lodgings in August."</p>

<p>"Are we going to Sandy Bay in August?"</p>

<p>"Yes; didn't you know? And I shall have four days of
perfect peace."</p>

<p>"You won't. You and Violet will disagree about hats,
or the colour of a dress, or the education of children,
or the true way of putting men in their proper place. It
isn't everybody who agrees with you as I do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know I shall miss you every minute of the time&mdash;that's
what you wanted me to say, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was it. You really do know how to lead me
by a silken thread."</p>

<p>"And I shall probably get my breakfast in bed. You'll
think of me, won't you, when you're breakfasting with the
children? And don't let John have jam every day."</p>

<p>"I shall give him," I said, "a pot for himself."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, pressing a paper into my hand.
"I've written down some things that <i>must</i> be attended to."</p>

<p>"I shan't attend to them," I shouted, as she walked off.</p>

<p>"Breakfast in bed," she called back.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>I have reason to believe that Scotland Yard has on occasion
displayed considerable intelligence, and I regret that
novelists will never allow it to be as cunning even as myself
in guessing the identity of the villains of their criminal plots.
Mrs. <span class="sc">Charles Bryce</span>, for instance, might, without unduly
taxing the imagination, have credited the Force with the coup
of bringing to justice the murderer of <i>Mrs. Vanderstein</i>,
but she went out of her way to employ that marvellous
amateur, <i>Mr. Gimblet</i>, for the purpose. I must believe
that he was marvellous, because she says so; but in this
case he did nothing and had little opportunity of justifying
his references. He merely believed what he had the luck to
be told and caused the miscreant to be arrested when of his
own motion he practically offered himself for arrest. There
are, after all, two phases of crime&mdash;the first, its commission,
and the second, its detection. Mrs. <span class="sc">Bryce</span> would have done
better to confine herself to the former, since she has an
exciting tale to tell of <i>Mrs. Vanderstein's Jewels</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) and
shows herself well able to curdle the blood in the telling of
it. But, lacking that gift of logic which is essential to the
stating and the solving of detective problems, she endeavours
to achieve her ends by keeping back what are
admitted, and not discovered, facts. She is reduced to telling
the same story twice, and I cannot say that I was nearly
as excited the second time as I was the first.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Once upon a time <span class="sc">King James</span>, being annoyed with the
City because it wouldn't lend him money, summoned the
<span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span> and Aldermen to his presence and, "being
somewhat transported," threatened to remove his Court to
some other place. To this the <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span> very politely
but readily retorted, "Your Majesty hath power to do what
you please and your City of London will obey accordingly:
but she humbly desires that when your Majesty shall
remove your Court you would please to leave the Thames
behind you." I think this single instance from the history
of the City goes far to explain that peculiar pride in it
which the Londoner instinctively feels without exactly
knowing why. I have not space to argue with Sir <span class="sc">Laurence
Gomme</span> upon his main point, its continuity of policy and
purpose from the Roman Empire till to-day, shown by the
records of London's past. I leave it to the scholar and
antiquary. It is my purpose to persuade the man in the
street, to whom the names of <span class="sc">Palgrave</span>, <span class="sc">Freeman</span> and
<span class="sc">Stubbs</span> are not household words, to buy a copy of <i>London</i>
(<span class="sc">Williams and Norgate</span>) for inclusion in his permanent
library. If I should insist upon his reading it then and
there he would reply, as one ignorant fellow to another,
that he had not the necessary understanding of the remote
past and was too preoccupied with the affairs of the present.
Be it so, but none the less let him buy it and at any rate
glance at its many curious and admirable illustrations.
Later he will dip into it in search of further episodes after
the manner of that I quote, and lastly he will do the thing
thoroughly, to find that he is much more concerned with
the past than ever he supposed; that now he understands
that "greatness which is London," and that he is infinitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>[pg 460]</span>
obliged for the recommendation of a not-too-learned clerk
who shared his own diffidence, even reluctance, in approaching
so learned and weighty a treatise.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I am sure that Miss <span class="sc">Constance Holme</span> has, in <i>The
Lonely Plough</i> (<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>), written a clever and
amusing novel. What she has not done is to make herself
intelligible. Some of the mist that enwraps the background
of her frontispiece has obscured her story and her
characters. I know that she is writing about lively and
entertaining people because there emerges, now and then, a
page of dialogue that is witty and alive; and I know that
her story is dramatic because she tells us now that someone
"let out a screech," and now that he "uttered sharp
little sounds remarkably like oaths." I know, too, that the
sea is encroaching upon somebody's dwelling-place, and that
someone else tries to keep the waves in their place, but is
no more successful than was the great King <span class="sc">Knut</span> of blessed
memory. Then there is
a fine figure of a land-agent
and several ladies
who talk the snappiest
of slang. But the mist
and the sea have swept
across Miss <span class="sc">Holme's</span>
pages and blotted out the
rest of the affair. Not
<span class="sc">Meredith</span> nor <span class="sc">Robert
Browning</span> at their most
complex have been more
baffling. I must admit,
however, that the description
of a game of
mixed hockey, somewhere
in the middle of
the book, was delightfully
fresh and vivid.
Here, for a page or two,
I could rest from my
grapplings with the story
and join in all the excitement
and peril, that
mixed hockey provides.
Then there is <i>Harriet</i>,
who says, "Stow all that
piffle." I should like to
know more about <i>Harriet</i>, who from that brief glimpse of
her seems a lively vigorous person, but the encroaching
sea swallows her with the others, and there is an end.
I repeat that Miss <span class="sc">Holme</span> has written a clever dramatic
story, but the title is certainly the clearest thing about it.</p>

<p>Even though it has been seared by the tragic end of a
youthful <i>liaison</i> ("It was in France, you know," and that
seems to explain all to <i>Minella Drake</i>, daughter of the Vicar
of Goldringham) the heart of a Sussex taxidermist appears
to be exceptionally tender. Seldom can <i>Tom Murrow</i>,
through whose eyes we view the scenes and incidents of
Mr. <span class="sc">Tickner Edwardes</span>' <i>Tansy</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>), have sealed
up badger or squirrel in its glass <i>morgue</i> without shedding
on the fur some glistening tribute of tears over a village
sorrow. So much of his time in fact is occupied by conversations
of a sentimental nature with the two <i>Wilverleys</i>
(whose aged father, <i>Mark</i>, by the way, having retired from
active life on his farm, habitually talks in rhymed couplets)
that he can have had as little leisure for stuffing specimens
as he had to discern the love gradually growing up for him
in the bosom of <i>Minella</i>, his guileless <i>confidante</i>. The background
of <i>Tansy</i> consists in the shepherd's seasons of the
Sussex downs (for <i>Tansy</i>, a splendid type of advanced
though rustic womanhood,
is a shepherdess),
and the plot of the story
is that of <i>Tess of the
D'Urbervilles</i>, with the
convenient variation that
the villain of the piece,
having his pockets stuffed
with cartridges, disappears
(as villains should)
in a cloud of malodorous
smoke. Mr. <span class="sc">Tickner
Edwardes</span>' knowledge of
rural life and scenes is
as thorough as his description
of them is
charming, and, if the
general impression conveyed
by <i>Tansy</i> is a little
too idyllic for those who
have been brought up
in the rough school of
Wessex agriculture, it is
pleasant for a moment
to lend ourselves to the
illusion of his sunny
romance.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Unattractive as <i>Sophia Ree</i> was in many ways, I frankly
admit that she was a lady of mettle. A stockbroker's
typist, with a fortune of &pound;2,000 and a salary of a few
shillings a week, she no sooner obtained inside information
about the floating of <i>The South Seas Coastal Rubber Development
Company</i> than she decided to apply for 2000 shares.
They were allotted to her, and in consequence she became
a most important person. In fact, she had only to say
"<i>Gugenheim</i>" to her employers and she had them at her
feet. Why this was so you must discover for yourselves;
all that I, who am no expert in financial matters, can tell
you is that somehow her 2000 shares seem to have
given her a position of enormous power in the company,
and that the <i>Gugenheim</i> man wanted to buy her out.
Her sister <i>Judith</i> kept bees and was an extremely good
woman. I never got really to understand her; and her
wonderful power of seeing into the future, which does not
often go with apiculture, left me unimpressed. The
trouble with this book of Mr. <span class="sc">E. R. Punshon's</span> is that the
parts of it do not seem to fit into a symmetrical whole, but,
at any rate, a study of <i>The Crowning Glory</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and
Stoughton</span>) has greatly improved my knowledge of the
behaviour of bears and bulls and bees.</p>
